  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the  standard <strong>Mmarkup <u>language</u> for documents</strong> designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
  <h3>Same five genres as before (with about 120-130 million words per genre),<br>plus the three new genres:</h3>
  <p>Blog posts and other web pages (120-130 million words for each of these two genres). So much of what we consume nowadays comes from the web, and these genres include many words that don't occur much elsewhere (e.g. ebook, webpage, browsing, password, template, meme, snarky, off-topic, downloadable, open-source, updated, (to) monetize, upgrade, debunk, archive, pirate, upgrade).

  <p style="margin-top:42px;">TV and movies subtitles (130 million words). This is by far the most informal language we've ever had in COCA. Many studies (e.g. A, B, and C show that the data from subtitles agrees with native speaker intuitions about their language even better than the data from actual everyday conversation (like in the BNC). Until now, COCA didn't really have this highly informal language.</p>
